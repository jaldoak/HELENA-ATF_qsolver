--------------------------------

isotropic qsolver added
To run; set IGAM=5 and use VF2 for q profile input
B -> A*B.
NMESH is number of iterations for qsolver loop

Example namelist files:
F2_example     (isotropic ballooning scenario with F^2 input)
q_example      (the same ballooning scenario with safety factor input)

anisotropic q-sovler does not work, but example inputs are included for testing
anisF2_example (an anisotropic ballooning scenario with F^2 input)
anisq_example  (the same ballooning scenario with safety factor input [DOES NOT YET WORK])

q-solver tolerance currently set to max(|[IA,IB,IC,IB1,IB2,IB3]_new - [IA,IB,IC,IB1,IB2,IB3]_old|^2) <= 10^-6.
q-solver can converge to ~10^-12 if more accuracy is needed, but this is slow.
To change tolerance, make changes to line 645 [as of 18-April-2025]
645 >>      IF ((RES_CONV/DSQRT(NR-1.D0)).LT.1.D-6) THEN
646 >>        WRITE(*,*)
647 >>        WRITE(*,*) 'Q-SOLVER FLUX INTEGRALS CONVERGED:', 
648 >>     >    RES_CONV/DSQRT(NR-1.D0)

Matlab script qsolver_plot.m will make some plots with the example files
Change the directories to your own paths for MHD_scripts-master and HELENA+ATF (for the q-solver version).
